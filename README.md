## ðŸ’« About Me
Iâ€™m a passionate machine learning researcher and developer with experience in natural language processing, retrieval-augmented generation, and multilingual large language models. I have worked on a variety of projects, including mitigating bias in computer vision, low-resource machine translation, code-mixed sentiment analysis, LLM data augmentation, RAG for various applications, and food detection, and have expertise working in various environments such as Google Colab, Mathematica, and VS Code. Currently, Iâ€™m working on retrieval-augmented generation for open book question answering. In my free time, I love to dance, write, paint, and travel.
